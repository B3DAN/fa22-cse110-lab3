            Our video recording equipment was not setup for the first part of this discussion, but it was recorded for playback purposes <br>
            <figure>
                <figcaption><i>First Discussion Audio</i></figcaption>
                <audio controls src="audio/12th Street Rag.mp3"></audio>
            </figure>
            The main takeaways from the audio are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We have no idea what we're doing
                </li>
                <li>
                    Powell is the most experienced so he will be doing 80% of the code
                </li>
                <li>
                    We all are expecting at least 110% in the class
                </li>
            </ul>

            Eventually we were able to set up our camera, so we were able to record the rest of the discussion
            <figure>

                </video>
            </figure>

            The main take aways from the video are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    None of us know how to setup a camera
                </li>
                <li>
                    Music increases profits
